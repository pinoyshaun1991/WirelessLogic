Wireless Logic Task
===============================

### Implementation

This test has been developed using no framework. Autoload generated by composer enabled all the classes that have been created to be loaded and used by means of namespaces. 

The codebase adhered to using interfaces and abstract classes from within the Common directory. Within the ItemModel.php file, the getter and setter magic methods have been put in place for not only creating the properties of that class, but to provide validation on what is being set when it comes to displaying the correct data.
A third party library was used to scrape the given web page called Goutte installed via Composer.

Unit tests have been carried out within the codebase using both reflection and mocking approaches.

### How to test

1. Using the terminal, cd into the root directory of the project and execute the following ` php src/Script/index.php`.
2. A json encoded array will then be presented of the list of items showing the most expensive first.
3. Unit tests have been implemented using PHP Unit, to execute please cd to the root directory and run the following command `./vendor/bin/phpunit tests`.
